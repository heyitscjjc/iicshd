# Easily integrate a Watson Assistant Chatbot in a PHP web application

This project allows you to easily integrate a responsive banner at the bottom of web page with a button to a chat panel powered by IBM Watson. The aim of this project is to help developers with a kind of framework to integrate IBM Watson services into PHP web applications, by providing a pre-defined structure based on jQuery, AJAX, cURL and PHP.


## Prerequisites

In order to use this code, it's necessary to have:

1. An IBM Cloud account. It's free of charge, no credit card required (only a valid email address)
2. A Watson Assistant Lite Service (free of charge)
3. A trained Watson Assistant Workspace -> you can start from this folder (italian): https://github.com/lucacrippa88/watson-assistant-php/tree/master/virtual-assistant-ui-mysql-php
4. A PHP application: please hate a look to this tutorial to create it on IBM Cloud (... to come)


## How to use basic Chatbot features

Integrate this code by following the following customization steps:

1. Download or fork code
2. Edit php/ChatBot.php file with Watson Assistant credentials (username & password), release date of api, Workspace ID of the selected Virtual Assistant
3. Edit CSS to fit in your web application's graphics
4. Edit getWatsonAssistantData() in js/chatbot.js with context variable names to be checked in order to perform actions
5. Edit useWatsonAssistantData() in js/chatbot.js with personal code to perform actions


## How to improve Chatbot features

Improve the Chatbot with MySQL writing, create push notification, sending emails to support. These are only general ideas on how to create integration with MySQL, push notifications and email delivery: some coding skills are requested to integrate the solution into your web applications. For more info, please review video tutorials.

Write to MySQL database: use saveDataWA() in mysql-functions.js to create Ajax calls to your DB update APIs. The saveDataWA() functions take input from useWAData() included in chatbot.js.

Send push notification: to be updated.

### Send emails

You can train the Chatbot to understand when the user is asking to create an email message. The Assistant will start to collect all the needed info, handling a natural conversation with digressions enabled and fluent interactions.
The Assistant will collect the subject, the text and the recipients, then a confirmation to proceed to send the email.
Please note: your php server needs to be enabled to send emails.

### Create push notification

To be updated.


## Features

2. Enables to retrieve data from user in order to perform actions triggered by context variables, such as writing on a DB
3. Allows to create and send an email i.e. to the support team
4. Allows to create and send a web push notification -> under development! -> OneSignal required! https://onesignal.com/
